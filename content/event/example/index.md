summary: I will demonstrate how visualisation tools can be used to assess the imputation performance.
abstract: 'Multiple imputation has been widely used to handle missing data. There are an increasing number of software packages available for multiple imputation. However, before proceeding with statistical inference, it is crucial for practitioners to assess the quality of multiply-imputed values, particularly when using multiple imputation implementations based on machine learning algorithms. To help with this, we have developed an R package vismi, which offers comprehensive visual diagnostics for evaluating multiple imputation generated by different packages. In this talk, we will demonstrate various functions of vismi, and showcase its practical utility through case studies.'
